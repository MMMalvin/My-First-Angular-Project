    What is this project about?

    This is my first angular webpage. It is a simple webpage that displays the forecast for the given city.

    I used a free online Web API to make calls and data called RapidAPI (https://rapidapi.com/hub). Since it is free I am limited to 
    a few API calls a month. 
 
    If the search bar does not appear when launching the webpage then the WebAPI would have reached its limit for calls.

    If the Web API calls are still available then the user can launch the webpage and insert the city name at the top then 
    the application will make a call to the WEB API to get the data. 

    To run the application.

    Install the Angular CLI (if not already installed)
    -- npm install -g @angular/cli

    Run the application
    -- ng serve --open
